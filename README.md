# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
	The purpose of the new analysis would be to break down the new data, pyber_summary_df, in the first
deliverable. We have created our new dataframe by pulling out necessary information to construct it from our
merged dataframe. The pieces of information we have found were broken down specific to Rural, Suburban, and
Urban areas by grouping city types. We have found total rides, total drivers, total fares, avreage fare per
ride, and average fare per driver to help us better understand what these numbers mean in our dataframe.
We were able to take this one step further by reconstructing our dataframe and taking a look at the sum of
the fares per day between a certain time period. Then the dataframe that was created was broken down into the
period of weeks rather than days to observe the data regarding the sum of fares. To sum it up, the new analysis
has allowed us to understand the information behind these numbers that are simply on display, and can be even
arranged in a format to understand a specific portion of the dataframe such as the sum of the fares over a specific
frame of time.

## Results
	When breaking down the results, let's begin with the average fare per driver since this would be the
most attractive piece of data. When we observe, we notice that the data is broken down into three different
city types. We notice that the rural drivers make the most and urban drivers make the least. We also notice that
rural types also have the least amount of the total drivers by quite a significant amount in the data that was
collected. This could be one factor which contributes towards allowing the average fare per driver in rural areas
being the highest. There could be other factors that may influence these costs which may have to do with the
distance between destinations in rural areas which may play a role in increasing the average fares. Another factor
to notice would be the difference in the ratio of drivers to rides in Rural and Urban areas. To break it
down in the most simple form, rural areas have a ratio greater than 1 while Urban areas have less than 1. This
would mean that the average fare per driver may also be higher because out of total drivers in rural areas, some
are making more than one trip which may be a factor in why the average fare per driver is significantly higher
than urban drivers whose drivers to rides are lower than 1.

## Summary
	Few business recommendations to address the disparities among the city types would be to possibly grab
a more evenly distrubted pool of driver to get a better picture of the data to understand how drivers compare
within each city type. In our data, we see that rural drivers don't even make up to 5% of the total drivers.
It may be possible that the uneven distribution of the drivers have an influence on the difference between
the average fare per driver and ride. If we were to assume that this data represents the information regarding
the drivers accurately, couple recommendations that I would make would be to either decrease the fares in rural areas
to possibly influence customers to use the Pyber service that find the fares too expensive to indulge in.
This may allow for an increase of customers in rural areas.The other suggestion, to increase the fares in urban areas,
could be beneficial as urban areas have the greatest amount of total rides. These suggestions allow for small
profits to be multiplied by a great amount or allow for small losses to be made up for an increase in frequency
for the request of the service.
